Lamp by Shel Silverstein
Lamp loves me,
Lamp cares,
Lamp picks me peaches and pears.
Lamp offers me candy and Cokes,
Lamp listens and laughs at me jokes.
Lamp helps when I get in a fight,
Lamp does all my homework at night.
Lamp misses me,
Lamp cries,
Lamp thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Lamp is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Lamp just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Lamp's hand,
In the darkness where Lamp usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Lamp's gone!
